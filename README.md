 Training GPT2 on Andre's Zero to Hero series

# Intructions
First off, go to the CreateDataset dir. From there run the downloadaudio.py and then the transcribe.py in order. From there you can either run QA.py and then combineddata.py to generate some data for you for training using gemma, or create one by yourself based on the transcriptions. If you do the former I suggest checking the data before the next step.

In the training dir, just run the ipynb file. You can tweak it to your needs tho.

# Random rambling thoughts
I must admit the generating is not great, but that's fine cuz it's GPT2. You could achieve the same or better with a simple RAG pipeline. But eh it's whatever, it was fun to code this up. Anyways, done with my beloved Python.
